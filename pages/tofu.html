    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Here is the recipe for a delicious Korean delicacy, the Korean Braised Tofu</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>For this recipe we need the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>Light Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Gochugaru or Chili Flake</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil and Seeds</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut your tofu into 1/2″ to 1″ thick rectangles and pat dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Next, you’ll want to mix together your braising sauce, which consists of soy sauce, water gochugaru, sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, chopped garlic and scallions. Mix this together in a small both and put this next to your pan along with your prepared tofu</li>
        <li>Preheat 2 tbsp of oil over medium high heat in a non-stick pan and you’re ready to cook!</li>
        <li>Once the oil has preheated over medium high heat, gently add your tofu to the pan. Pan fry the tofu for 2 minutes per side until they are golden brown all over.</li>
        <li>After the tofu is golden brown on all sides, reduce the heat to medium and add the braising sauce. Braise the tofu for 5-6 minutes over medium heat, spooning the sauce over the tofu as it continues cooking.</li>
        <li>You’ll see that the sauce will start to thicken up and reduce, which will create a beautiful pan sauce to spoon over your tofu!</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
